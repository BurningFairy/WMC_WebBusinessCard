# WMC_WebBusinessCard

A small personal website created for a school project. It introduces me, shows my pets, includes a contact form, and has a simple clicker game.
Originally, this project was planned to include a React application integrated into the website. However, due to difficulty figuring out how to properly set up and integrate React with the existing project structure, this feature was not completed. The site was instead finished using standard web technologies.

## Pages / Sections

- **Home**: short introduction and basic information about me
- **My Pets**: pictures and descriptions of my pets
- **Contact**: a contact form to send a message
- **Clicker Game**: a small game where you click to increase your score
